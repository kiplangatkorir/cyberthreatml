# CyberThreat-ML

A Python library for real-time cybersecurity threat detection using TensorFlow.

## Overview

CyberThreat-ML is a comprehensive library for building, training, and deploying machine learning models to detect cyber threats in real-time. It provides tools for processing network traffic data, training models, evaluating performance, explaining predictions, and deploying models in real-time detection systems.

## Features

- Core ML model for cybersecurity threat detection
- Support for real-time data processing and threat detection
- Binary classification of potential threats
- Model training, evaluation, and persistence
- Model explainability using SHAP
- Preprocessing utilities for network traffic data
- API for integration into security systems

## Installation

```bash
pip install cyberthreat-ml
