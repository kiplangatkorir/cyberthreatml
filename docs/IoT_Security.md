## Introduction

Internet of Things (IoT) devices face unique security challenges due to their resource constraints, diverse protocols, and often insufficient security measures. CyberThreat-ML provides IoT-specific threat detection capabilities designed to operate effectively in IoT environments.

Key benefits of using CyberThreat-ML for IoT security:

- **Resource-efficient detection**: Optimized for devices with limited computational power
- **Protocol-aware analysis**: Support for IoT-specific protocols
- **Edge & cloud deployment options**: Deploy detection at the edge, gateway, or cloud
- **Anomaly-based detection**: Identify unusual behavior even without known signatures
- **Explainable results**: Understand why a device was flagged as potentially compromised

## IoT-Specific Threats

CyberThreat-ML can detect the following IoT-specific threats:

| Threat Type | Description | Detection Method |
|-------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Botnet Activity** | IoT devices recruited into botnets for DDoS attacks | Traffic pattern analysis, outbound connection monitoring |
| **Firmware Tampering** | Unauthorized modifications to device firmware | Checksum verification, behavior deviation analysis |
| **Command Injection** | Malicious commands sent to exploit vulnerable devices | Command pattern analysis, unusual command sequences |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Unauthorized data being sent from devices | Outbound data volume monitoring, destination analysis |
| **Replay Attacks** | Captured valid data transmissions replayed by attackers | Time pattern analysis, duplicate message detection |

## Lightweight Detection

CyberThreat-ML offers several approaches for resource-constrained IoT environments:

### Edge Detection
- Optimized models with reduced parameter counts
- Quantized inference for minimal memory footprint
- Batched processing to reduce CPU utilization

### Gateway-Level Detection
- Aggregated analysis of multiple device streams
- Pattern recognition across device clusters
- Protocol-specific anomaly detection

### Cloud-Based Analysis
- Historical pattern analysis
- Fleet-wide anomaly detection
- Advanced correlation with other security telemetry

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Individual IoT Devices

```python
# Example: Lightweight detector for a single IoT device
from cyberthreat_ml.model import ThreatDetectionModel, load_model
from cyberthreat_ml.realtime import RealTimeDetector

# Load a pre-trained lightweight model
model = load_model("models/iot_edge_model")

# Create a simple feature extractor for device telemetry
class DeviceFeatureExtractor:
    def transform(self, telemetry):
        # Extract relevant features from device telemetry
        # Return a vector with normalized features
        return features

# Initialize detector with minimal batch size
detector = RealTimeDetector(
    model, 
    DeviceFeatureExtractor(),
    batch_size=1,  # Process individual readings
    processing_interval=5.0  # Check every 5 seconds to save power
)

# Register callback for threats
detector.register_threat_callback(lambda result: alert_function(result))
detector.start()

# Feed device readings to detector
while device_is_active:
    reading = get_device_reading()
    detector.add_data(reading)
    time.sleep(1)
```

### For IoT Gateways

For gateways monitoring multiple devices, use the `IoTDeviceDetector` class which provides:

- Device state tracking
- Per-device anomaly detection
- Correlation between device behaviors

## Integration with IoT Platforms

CyberThreat-ML can be integrated with popular IoT platforms:

### AWS IoT Core
- Deploy models using AWS Greengrass
- Process device shadows for behavioral analysis
- Integrate with AWS IoT Device Defender

### Azure IoT Hub
- Use Edge modules for detection
- Integrate with Azure Security Center
- Leverage IoT Hub routes for security telemetry

### Google Cloud IoT
- Deploy models to Edge TPU devices
- Integrate with Security Command Center
- Use Cloud Functions for detection logic

## Best Practices

1. **Baseline normal behavior** for each device type before deploying detection
2. **Layer defenses** with both edge and cloud detection
3. **Segment IoT networks** to contain potential compromises
4. **Update detection models** regularly as device firmware changes
5. **Monitor battery impact** of security monitoring on battery-powered devices
6. **Customize detection thresholds** based on device criticality
7. **Implement secure boot** where possible to prevent tampering
8. **Correlate alerts** across multiple devices to detect coordinated attacks

## Example Code

The CyberThreat-ML library includes a comprehensive IoT security example:

```bash
# Run the IoT security example
python examples/iot_security.py
```

This example demonstrates:
- IoT-specific threat detection
- Lightweight anomaly detection algorithms
- Device state tracking and analysis
- IoT-specific visualization and reporting
