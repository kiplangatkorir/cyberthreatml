# CyberThreat-ML: Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is CyberThreat-ML?
CyberThreat-ML is a Python library for real-time cybersecurity threat detection using machine learning. It provides tools for building, training, and deploying ML models that can detect both known (signature-based) and unknown (zero-day) threats.

### What makes CyberThreat-ML different from other security tools?
CyberThreat-ML combines traditional signature-based detection with modern ML-based anomaly detection, providing highly explainable results. It's designed specifically for cybersecurity applications with built-in visualization, real-time processing, and actionable intelligence.

### What types of threats can it detect?
It can detect a wide range of threats including:
- Network-based attacks (port scans, DDoS, etc.)
- Authentication attacks (brute force)
- Data theft (exfiltration)
- Zero-day attacks (previously unknown patterns)
- Malware communication patterns

### Is CyberThreat-ML production-ready?
The library demonstrates many characteristics of production-ready code, including comprehensive error handling, detailed logging, and thorough documentation. However, proper security testing and performance optimization would be recommended before deploying in critical production environments.

## Technical Questions

### How do I install CyberThreat-ML?
```bash
pip install cyberthreat-ml
```

### What Python versions are supported?
Python 3.8 and above.

### What are the main dependencies?
- TensorFlow (for ML models)
- NumPy and Pandas (for data manipulation)
- scikit-learn (for anomaly detection algorithms)
- Matplotlib and Seaborn (for visualization)
- SHAP (for model explanations)

### Does CyberThreat-ML require GPU support?
No, it can run on CPU-only environments, but GPU acceleration will significantly improve training speed for larger models.

### How much data do I need to train effective models?
For signature-based detection, you typically need:
- At least 1,000 examples of normal traffic
- At least 100 examples of each type of attack you want to detect

For zero-day detection, you need:
- At least 500-1,000 examples of normal traffic

### Can I use my own custom models?
Yes, the library is designed to be modular. You can:
1. Implement your own feature extractors
2. Train your own TensorFlow models and load them
3. Create custom detection logic

## Functionality Questions

### How does the zero-day detection work?
Zero-day detection uses anomaly detection algorithms to identify patterns that deviate significantly from normal behavior. It works by:
1. Training only on normal, benign traffic
2. Learning the statistical patterns of normal behavior
3. Flagging anything that deviates too much from these patterns

The library implements multiple algorithms including Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and One-Class SVM, with the option to use an ensemble approach.

### How do I tune the false positive rate?
The main parameter that controls false positive rate is the `contamination` parameter when creating a `ZeroDayDetector`:

```python
# Lower contamination = fewer false positives but might miss some threats
detector = ZeroDayDetector(contamination=0.01)  # Expects 1% anomalies

# Higher contamination = more sensitive detection but more false positives
detector = ZeroDayDetector(contamination=0.05)  # Expects 5% anomalies
```

### How can I interpret detection results?
CyberThreat-ML provides several tools for interpretability:

1. For zero-day threats:
   - The `analyze_anomaly()` method provides detailed analysis
   - `get_anomaly_description()` generates human-readable descriptions
   - Each detection includes severity scores and top contributing features

2. For signature-based detection:
   - The `ThreatInterpreter` class provides SHAP-based explanations
   - Visualization tools help understand prediction confidence

### Can it process traffic in real-time?
Yes, the `RealTimeDetector` and `PacketStreamDetector` classes are designed for real-time processing with configurable batch sizes and processing intervals.

### How does adaptive learning work?
The `RealTimeZeroDayDetector` includes adaptive learning capabilities through the `train_on_recent_normal()` method. This allows the detector to adapt to evolving network patterns over time by periodically retraining on recent data that wasn't flagged as anomalous.

## Integration Questions

### Can I integrate CyberThreat-ML with my SIEM?
Yes, you can integrate through several approaches:
1. Use the callback functions to forward alerts to your SIEM
2. Log detection results in a format your SIEM can ingest
3. Implement a custom integration layer between the detector and your SIEM

### How can I deploy CyberThreat-ML in a production environment?
Common deployment patterns include:
1. As a standalone monitoring service
2. As part of a security analytics pipeline
3. Embedded in network monitoring appliances
4. As an API service that processes batched or streamed data

### Can CyberThreat-ML process PCAP files?
Yes, the library includes utilities for parsing PCAP files and extracting relevant features for analysis in the `utils` module.

### Does it support encrypted traffic analysis?
The library can analyze encrypted traffic based on metadata features (timing, size, etc.) without decrypting the content, though deep packet inspection features would require decrypted traffic.

## Performance Questions

### How many packets per second can it process?
Performance depends on:
- Hardware specifications
- Model complexity
- Feature extraction overhead
- Batch size configuration

On modern hardware, the real-time detectors can typically process thousands of packets per second when properly configured.

### How do I optimize for high-throughput environments?
For high-throughput environments:
1. Increase batch size (`batch_size` parameter)
2. Simplify feature extraction
3. Use a simpler model architecture
4. Consider parallel processing for feature extraction
5. Leverage GPU acceleration if available

### How much memory does it require?
Memory usage depends primarily on:
- The size of your models
- Batch size configuration
- History length for zero-day detection
- Visualization dashboard configuration

Most deployments can run effectively with 2-4GB of RAM.

## Best Practices

### What's the recommended workflow for getting started?
1. Start with the basic examples to understand the library
2. Collect and prepare your network data
3. Train a signature-based model on known threats
4. Train a zero-day detector on normal traffic
5. Implement real-time monitoring with appropriate callbacks
6. Regularly retrain models as you collect more data

### How often should I retrain my models?
- Signature-based models: When new threat types emerge or detection performance decreases
- Zero-day detectors: Every 1-4 weeks depending on how quickly your network patterns evolve

### How can I reduce false positives?
1. Use high-quality training data that truly represents normal traffic
2. Start with a low contamination rate (0.01) and adjust as needed
3. Implement the hybrid approach (signature + anomaly detection)
4. Enable adaptive learning to adjust to evolving baselines
5. Add domain-specific rules to filter out known benign anomalies

### Is there a recommended hardware configuration?
For development and testing:
- 4+ CPU cores
- 8GB+ RAM
- SSD storage

For production environments:
- 8+ CPU cores
- 16GB+ RAM
- GPU (optional, for larger models)
- SSD storage
