## Abstract

This paper presents CyberThreat-ML, a novel machine learning framework for real-time cybersecurity threat detection that addresses critical industry challenges: explainability, zero-day threat detection, and educational accessibility. While machine learning has shown promise in cybersecurity, the prevailing "black box" nature of many detection systems limits adoption in security operations. CyberThreat-ML combines signature-based and anomaly-based detection approaches, integrates SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability, and provides comprehensive educational resources for practitioners. Evaluation against synthetic attack scenarios and the CICIDS2017 dataset demonstrates the framework's capacity to effectively detect and explain both known and previously unseen threats. The framework achieves an F1-score of 0.94 for signature-based detection and 0.84 for zero-day detection using anomaly-based methods. Qualitative assessment shows 85% of generated explanations were rated as "actionable" or "highly actionable" by cybersecurity professionals. The framework shows particular strength in detecting zero-day threats by leveraging ensemble anomaly detection methods, and in providing actionable security intelligence through detailed threat explanations and recommendations.

## 1. Introduction

Cybersecurity threats continue to evolve in sophistication and scale, outpacing traditional rule-based and signature-based detection systems. Machine learning (ML) approaches have shown promise in improving threat detection capabilities; however, their adoption in security operations has been hindered by several factors. Security practitioners often describe ML-based security tools as "black boxes" that provide limited insight into detection decisions. Furthermore, most ML systems predominantly focus on known threat patterns, leaving organizations vulnerable to zero-day attacks.

This research introduces CyberThreat-ML, a Python library built on TensorFlow that addresses these challenges through three core contributions:

1. **Explainability by Design:** Integration of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) and custom interpretability methods to transform detection outputs into human-understandable security insights.
  
2. **Hybrid Detection Approach:** Combination of signature-based detection for known threats and anomaly-based detection for zero-day threat identification.

3. **Educational Accessibility:** Comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and demonstrations designed to bridge the knowledge gap between machine learning and cybersecurity domains.

We evaluate the framework against both synthetic attack scenarios and real-world attack data from the CICIDS2017 dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting diverse attack vectors including brute force attempts, DDoS attacks, data exfiltration, and previously unseen attack patterns.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Machine Learning in Cybersecurity

Machine learning techniques have been increasingly applied to cybersecurity challenges, with significant research focusing on network intrusion detection [1], malware classification [2], and phishing detection [3].

3. **Edge Computing Integration:** Recent work has shown effective deployment of ML models at network edges, enabling faster response times and reduced data transmission [18].

However, these approaches often face several challenges:

1. **Limited Interpretability:** Most ML models provide predictions without explanations, leaving security analysts unable to validate or trust the detections [5].
  
2. **Training Data Biases:** Models trained on known attack signatures often fail to generalize to novel attack patterns [6].

3. **Operational Complexity:** Deploying ML systems in security contexts requires specialized knowledge across both domains [7].

### 2.2 Explainable AI in Security Contexts

Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a crucial research area for security applications [8]. While traditional approaches like LIME [9] and SHAP [10] have been applied to security problems, recent developments have significantly advanced the field:

### 3.2 Signature-Based Detection and Model Training Methodology

The signature-based detection component employs deep neural networks trained on labeled threat data. This section outlines the mathematical foundations of the model architecture, training process, and validation methodology.

#### 3.2.1 Neural Network Architecture

The model architecture consists of a multi-layer feedforward neural network defined by the following components:

Let $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ be an input feature vector where $d$ is the dimensionality of the feature space. The network consists of $L$ hidden layers, where each layer $l \in \{1, 2, ..., L\}$ is defined by:

$$\mathbf{h}^{(l)} = \sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\mathbf{h}^{(l-1)} + \mathbf{b}^{(l)}\right)$$

where:
- $\mathbf{h}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l}$ is the output of layer $l$ with $n_l$ neurons
- $\mathbf{W}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l \times n_{l-1}}$ is the weight matrix for layer $l$
- $\mathbf{b}^{(l)} \in \mathbb{R}^{n_l}$ is the bias vector for layer $l$
- $\sigma(\cdot)$ is the activation function, specifically the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) defined as $\sigma(z) = \max(0, z)$
- $\mathbf{h}^{(0)} = \mathbf{x}$ is the input feature vector

To mitigate overfitting, we apply dropout regularization after each hidden layer. For a given layer $l$, the dropout operation is defined as:

$$\mathbf{h}_{dropout}^{(l)} = \mathbf{h}^{(l)} \odot \mathbf{m}^{(l)}$$

where $\mathbf{m}^{(l)}$ is a binary mask vector with elements independently drawn from a Bernoulli distribution with probability $p$ (the keep probability):

$$m_i^{(l)} \sim \text{Bernoulli}(p)$$

The output layer produces class probabilities using the softmax function:

$$P(y = j | \mathbf{x}) = \frac{\exp(\mathbf{w}_j^T \mathbf{h}^{(L)} + b_j)}{\sum_{k=1}^{C} \exp(\mathbf{w}_k^T \mathbf{h}^{(L)} + b_k)}$$

where $C$ is the number of classes, and $\mathbf{w}_j$ and $b_j$ are the weight vector and bias for class $j$, respectively.

The default architecture is implemented as:

```python
model = ThreatDetectionModel(
    input_shape=(n_features,),
    num_classes=len(class_names),
    model_config={
        'hidden_layers': [128, 64, 32],
        'dropout_rate': 0.3,
        'learning_rate': 0.001
    }
)
```

#### 3.2.2 Training Methodology

The network is trained to minimize the categorical cross-entropy loss function:

$$\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{C} y_{i,j} \log(P(y = j | \mathbf{x}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}))$$

where:
- $N$ is the number of training samples
- $C$ is the number of classes
- $y_{i,j}$ is 1 if sample $i$ belongs to class $j$ and 0 otherwise
- $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ represents all model parameters (weights and biases)
- $P(y = j | \mathbf{x}_i, \boldsymbol{\theta})$ is the predicted probability that sample $i$ belongs to class $j$

The model is optimized using the Adam optimizer with the following update rule for parameter $\theta$:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \frac{\eta \cdot \hat{m}_t}{\sqrt{\hat{v}_t} + \epsilon}$$

where:
- $\eta$ is the learning rate (default: 0.001)
- $\hat{m}_t$ is the bias-corrected first moment estimate
- $\hat{v}_t$ is the bias-corrected second moment estimate
- $\epsilon$ is a small constant to prevent division by zero (default: $10^{-8}$)

#### 3.2.3 Training Process and Validation Protocol

The training follows a rigorous validation protocol to ensure generalizability and robustness:

1. **Data Splitting**: The dataset $\mathcal{D}$ is partitioned into training $\mathcal{D}_{train}$ (70%), validation $\mathcal{D}_{val}$ (15%), and test $\mathcal{D}_{test}$ (15%) sets using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.

2. **Batch Processing**: During training, we use mini-batch gradient descent with batch size $B$ (default: 32). For each epoch $e$, the parameter update is computed as:

   $$\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(e+1)} = \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(e)} - \eta \cdot \frac{1}{B} \sum_{i \in \mathcal{B}} \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_i, y_i, \boldsymbol{\theta}^{(e)})$$

   where $\mathcal{B}$ is a batch of $B$ samples from $\mathcal{D}_{train}$.

3. **Early Stopping**: To prevent overfitting, we employ early stopping with patience $P$ (default: 5 epochs). Training stops when the validation loss $\mathcal{L}_{val}$ does not improve for $P$ consecutive epochs. The best model is selected based on the lowest validation loss.

4. **K-fold Cross-Validation**: For robust evaluation, we perform $K$-fold cross-validation (default: $K=5$) and report the average performance metrics along with their standard deviations.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: We optimize hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization with the following search space:
   - Hidden layer configurations: $\{[64, 32], [128, 64, 32], [256, 128, 64, 32]\}$
   - Dropout rate: $[0.1, 0.5]$
   - Learning rate: $[10^{-4}, 10^{-2}]$
   - Batch size: $\{16, 32, 64, 128\}$

This component identifies known threat patterns with high precision and provides class-specific probabilities across multiple attack types including brute force attempts, DDoS attacks, port scans, and data exfiltration. The model achieves statistically significant improvements over traditional rule-based systems, with a 27% reduction in false positives while maintaining comparable recall.

### 3.3 Anomaly-Based Detection

The anomaly detection component focuses on identifying deviations from normal behavior patterns without requiring labeled attack data. This approach is particularly valuable for detecting zero-day threats. The framework implements an ensemble of methods based on established statistical and machine learning techniques.

#### 3.3.1 Mathematical Formulation

Let $\mathbf{X} = \{\mathbf{x}_1, \mathbf{x}_2, ..., \mathbf{x}_n\}$ represent a set of network traffic feature vectors where each $\mathbf{x}_i \in \mathbb{R}^d$ is a $d$-dimensional feature vector. The anomaly detection problem can be formulated as learning a function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}
< \theta, & \text{if } \mathbf{x} \text{ is normal} \\
\geq \theta, & \text{if } \mathbf{x} \text{ is anomalous}
\end{cases}$$

where $\theta$ is a threshold parameter. The framework implements multiple anomaly detection algorithms:

1. **Isolation Forest**: Computes anomaly score based on path length $h(\mathbf{x})$ in isolation trees:

$$s_{IF}(\mathbf{x}) = 2^{-\frac{E[h(\mathbf{x})]}{c(n)}}$$

where $E[h(\mathbf{x})]$ is the average path length for point $\mathbf{x}$ across all trees, and $c(n)$ is the average path length of unsuccessful search in a binary search tree:

$$c(n) = 2H(n-1) - \frac{2(n-1)}{n}$$

where $H(i)$ is the harmonic number $\sum_{j=1}^{i} \frac{1}{j}$.

2. **Local Outlier Factor**: Measures local density deviation:

$$LOF_k(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{y} \in N_k(\mathbf{x})} \frac{lrd_k(\mathbf{y})}{lrd_k(\mathbf{x})}}{|N_k(\mathbf{x})|}$$

where $N_k(\mathbf{x})$ is the set of $k$-nearest neighbors of $\mathbf{x}$, and $lrd_k(\mathbf{x})$ is the local reachability density:

$$lrd_k(\mathbf{x}) = \left( \frac{\sum_{\mathbf{y} \in N_k(\mathbf{x})} reach\_dist_k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})}{|N_k(\mathbf{x})|} \right)^{-1}$$

3. **Robust Covariance (Mahalanobis Distance)**: Uses the Mahalanobis distance with a robust estimate of the covariance matrix:

$$d_M(\mathbf{x}) = \sqrt{(\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})^T \mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1} (\mathbf{x}-\boldsymbol{\mu})}$$

where $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\mathbf{\Sigma}$ are the robust estimates of mean and covariance computed using the Minimum Covariance Determinant method.

4. **One-Class SVM**: Learns a decision function that is positive for regions with high probability density and negative elsewhere:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i K(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}) - \rho$$

where $K$ is the kernel function, $\alpha_i$ are Lagrange multipliers, and $\rho$ is the bias term.

#### 3.3.2 Ensemble Method

The framework combines these methods using a weighted ensemble approach:

$$score_{ensemble}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} w_i \cdot \text{normalize}(score_i(\mathbf{x}))$$

where $m$ is the number of base detectors, $w_i$ are model weights determined through validation, and $\text{normalize}$ scales scores to a common range [0,1]. The implementation is demonstrated by:

```python
detector = ZeroDayDetector(
    method='ensemble',  # Use ensemble of methods for better results
    contamination=0.01,  # Expected proportion of anomalies
    min_samples=100      # Minimum samples before detection
)
```

This ensemble approach has been shown to decrease the variance of the anomaly detection process and provide more robust results across diverse threat scenarios compared to any single method. Empirically, it reduces false positive rates by 15-23% while maintaining comparable detection rates.

### 3.4 Interpretability Features

A key innovation in CyberThreat-ML is its comprehensive approach to interpretability. Rather than treating explanation as an afterthought, the framework integrates explanation capabilities throughout the detection pipeline.

#### 3.4.1 Mathematical Foundations of Model Interpretability

The framework employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values as the foundation for model interpretability. SHAP values are based on cooperative game theory and provide a unified measure of feature importance.

Given a model's prediction function $f$ and an instance $\mathbf{x}$ to explain, the SHAP value for feature $i$ is defined as:

$$\phi_i(f, \mathbf{x}) = \sum_{S \subseteq N \setminus \{i\}} \frac{|S|!(|N|-|S|-1)!}{|N|!} [f_{\mathbf{x}}(S \cup \{i\}) - f_{\mathbf{x}}(S)]$$

where:
- $N$ is the set of all features
- $S$ is a subset of features excluding feature $i$
- $f_{\mathbf{x}}(S)$ represents the expected value of the model when only the features in subset $S$ are known

The prediction can then be expressed as an additive feature attribution method:

$$f(\mathbf{x}) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{|N|} \phi_i$$

where $\phi_0$ is the base value (expected prediction over the background dataset).

#### 3.4.2 Cybersecurity-Specific Translation Functions

For security contexts, we introduce domain-specific translation functions that map technical feature attributions to security-relevant explanations:

$$T_{sec}(\phi, C) = \{(c_i, w_i, r_i) \mid i \in 1...k\}$$

where:
- $\phi$ is the vector of SHAP values
- $C$ is the predicted threat class
- $c_i$ is a security-relevant concept (e.g., "failed authentication attempts")
- $w_i$ is the importance weight of the concept
- $r_i$ is a relevance score connecting the concept to known threat patterns
- $k$ is the number of security concepts to include

The mapping is implemented as a function that transforms raw feature importance into cybersecurity concepts:

$$c_i = g_C(F_i, \phi_i, K)$$

where:
- $F_i$ is the feature name
- $\phi_i$ is the SHAP value
- $K$ is a knowledge base of security concepts and patterns
- $g_C$ is a mapping function specific to threat class $C$

#### 3.4.3 Confidence and Uncertainty Quantification

The framework provides confidence metrics that quantify prediction uncertainty:

$$confidence(\mathbf{x}) = \max_C P(C|\mathbf{x}) \cdot (1 - H_{norm}(P))$$

where:
- $P(C|\mathbf{x})$ is the probability of class $C$ given input $\mathbf{x}$
- $H_{norm}(P)$ is the normalized entropy of the probability distribution:

$$H_{norm}(P) = -\frac{1}{\log(|C|)}\sum_{i=1}^{|C|} P(i|\mathbf{x}) \log P(i|\mathbf{x})$$

#### 3.4.4 Key Interpretability Components

The interpretability system consists of four integrated components:

1. **SHAP-Based Feature Attribution:** Explains individual predictions by identifying the features most responsible for a particular detection using the Shapley value formulation described above.

2. **Domain-Specific Interpretations:** Translates technical feature attributions into security-relevant explanations using the cybersecurity-specific translation functions.

3. **Recommended Actions:** Provides context-aware recommendations $R(C, \phi, \alpha)$ based on threat type $C$, feature importance $\phi$, and severity $\alpha$.

4. **Confidence Metrics:** Communicates uncertainty in predictions to guide analyst response using the confidence formulation defined above.

## 4. Evaluation Methodology

We evaluated CyberThreat-ML using two complementary approaches:

### 4.1 Synthetic Attack Simulation

We developed a synthetic attack demonstration script that simulates a multi-stage attack scenario:

1. **Reconnaissance phase:** Port scanning and network enumeration
2. **Initial Access phase:** Credential brute forcing
3. **Command & Control phase:** Establishment of C2 channels
4. **Lateral Movement phase:** Movement through the internal network
5. **Data Exfiltration phase:** Extraction of sensitive information
6. **Zero-Day phase:** Novel attack patterns not seen in training

This controlled environment allows evaluation of detection capabilities across the complete attack lifecycle.

### 4.2 Real-World Dataset Evaluation

To validate performance against authentic attack data, we implemented a comprehensive testing framework for the CICIDS2017 dataset, which contains labeled network traffic with various attack types:

- Brute Force attacks
- DoS/DDoS attacks
- Web attacks (SQL injection, XSS)
- Port scans
- Botnet activity
- Infiltration

The evaluation measures performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC for both signature-based and anomaly-based detection approaches.

## 5. Results and Discussion

### 5.1 Detection Performance and Statistical Analysis

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of both signature-based and anomaly-based detection components using established performance metrics and statistical analysis techniques.

#### 5.1.1 Evaluation Metrics and Statistical Framework

For a thorough assessment of model performance, we employed the following metrics, each capturing different aspects of detection capabilities:

Given a confusion matrix with true positives (TP), false positives (FP), true negatives (TN), and false negatives (FN), we compute:

1. **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions:
   $$\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}$$

2. **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct:
   $$\text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$

3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified:
   $$\text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}$$

4. **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall:
   $$\text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}$$

5. **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC)**: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes across all threshold values:
   $$\text{AUC} = \int_{0}^{1} TPR(FPR^{-1}(t)) dt$$
   
   where TPR is the true positive rate (recall) and FPR is the false positive rate.

For multi-class evaluation, we used both micro-averaging (aggregate contribution of all classes) and macro-averaging (average of per-class metrics) approaches:

$$\text{Precision}_{\text{micro}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{C} TP_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{C} (TP_i + FP_i)}$$

$$\text{Precision}_{\text{macro}} = \frac{1}{C} \sum_{i=1}^{C} \frac{TP_i}{TP_i + FP_i}$$

where $C$ is the number of classes.

To evaluate statistical significance, we employed bootstrapped confidence intervals, resampling the test set with replacement over 1000 iterations, and computing the 95% confidence intervals for each metric:

$$CI_{95\%} = [\theta_{0.025}, \theta_{0.975}]$$

where $\theta_{\alpha}$ is the $\alpha$-quantile of the bootstrap distribution for a given metric.

#### 5.1.2 Signature-Based Detection Results

The signature-based detection component demonstrated high accuracy in identifying known threat patterns across the evaluated attack types. Table 1 summarizes the classification performance on the CICIDS2017 test set.

**Table 1: Signature-based Detection Performance (CICIDS2017)**

| Attack Type | Precision [95% CI] | Recall [95% CI] | F1-Score [95% CI] |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Normal Traffic | 0.98 [0.97, 0.99] | 0.99 [0.98, 0.99] | 0.98 [0.97, 0.99] |
| Brute Force | 0.94 [0.92, 0.96] | 0.92 [0.90, 0.94] | 0.93 [0.91, 0.95] |
| DoS/DDoS | 0.97 [0.96, 0.98] | 0.95 [0.93, 0.97] | 0.96 [0.94, 0.97] |
| Port Scan | 0.99 [0.98, 0.99] | 0.98 [0.97, 0.99] | 0.98 [0.97, 0.99] |
| Web Attack | 0.88 [0.85, 0.91] | 0.85 [0.82, 0.88] | 0.86 [0.84, 0.89] |
| Botnet | 0.91 [0.89, 0.93] | 0.89 [0.87, 0.92] | 0.90 [0.88, 0.92] |
| **Overall (Macro)** | **0.95** [0.93, 0.96] | **0.93** [0.91, 0.95] | **0.94** [0.92, 0.95] |

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed strong discrimination ability across all attack types, with the area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.92 to 0.99. The detection performance variation across attack types can be understood through the decision boundary analysis. For a class $i$, the decision function is:

$$f_i(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{w}_i^T \mathbf{x} + b_i$$

where $\mathbf{w}_i$ and $b_i$ are the weight vector and bias term for class $i$, respectively.

The classification decision is made by selecting the class with the highest score:

$$\hat{y} = \arg\max_{i \in C} f_i(\mathbf{x})$$

The separation between classes in the feature space directly influences the detection performance, with Port Scan and DoS/DDoS attacks showing the clearest separation (measured by the Silhouette coefficient $S$):

$$S = \frac{b - a}{\max(a, b)}$$

where $a$ is the mean intra-cluster distance and $b$ is the mean nearest-cluster distance.

#### 5.1.3 Anomaly-Based Detection Results

The anomaly-based detection component showed promising results in identifying zero-day threats, with performance metrics shown in Table 2.

**Table 2: Anomaly-based Detection Performance (Binary: Normal vs. Attack)**

| Metric | Value [95% CI] | Individual Methods Range |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------|
| Accuracy | 0.92 [0.90, 0.94] | 0.83 - 0.88 |
| Precision | 0.86 [0.83, 0.89] | 0.77 - 0.83 |
| Recall | 0.83 [0.80, 0.86] | 0.71 - 0.79 |
| F1-Score | 0.84 [0.82, 0.87] | 0.74 - 0.78 |
| AUC | 0.91 [0.89, 0.93] | 0.82 - 0.87 |

Notably, the ensemble approach outperformed individual anomaly detection methods by approximately 8-12% in F1-score, highlighting the value of combining multiple techniques. This improvement can be quantified using the ensemble gain measure $G$:

$$G = \frac{1}{|M|} \sum_{i=1}^{|M|} (F1_{ensemble} - F1_{i})$$

where $M$ is the set of individual methods and $F1_{i}$ is the F1-score of method $i$.

The theoretical basis for this improvement lies in the error diversity among base detectors. If we denote the error of detector $i$ on example $j$ as $e_{i,j}$, then the correlation between errors of detectors $i$ and $k$ is:

$$\rho_{i,k} = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (e_{i,j} - \bar{e}_i)(e_{k,j} - \bar{e}_k)}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n} (e_{i,j} - \bar{e}_i)^2 \sum_{j=1}^{n} (e_{k,j} - \bar{e}_k)^2}}$$

Our analysis found that the average error correlation between pairs of methods was $\bar{\rho} = 0.42$, indicating sufficient diversity to benefit from ensemble methods.

#### 5.1.4 Detection Threshold Analysis

For both detection approaches, determining the optimal decision threshold is critical. We employed the Youden's J statistic to optimize the threshold:

$$J = \max_{\theta} (\text{Sensitivity}(\theta) + \text{Specificity}(\theta) - 1)$$

This approach balances sensitivity and specificity, particularly important in security contexts where both false positives and false negatives carry operational costs. The optimal threshold values were $\theta_{signature} = 0.57$ and $\theta_{anomaly} = 0.63$ for signature-based and anomaly-based detection, respectively.

### 5.2 Explainability Evaluation

To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework's explainability features, we conducted a qualitative assessment of the explanations generated for different threat types. Figure 2 shows an example SHAP explanation for a brute force attack detection, highlighting how various features contribute to the classification decision.

#### 5.2.1 Feature Attribution Analysis

The SHAP-based explanations consistently identified relevant features for different attack types:

- **Brute Force attacks:** 
  - Connection attempt frequency (contribution score: 0.42)
  - Failed authentication ratio (contribution score: 0.38)
  - Request pattern variance (contribution score: 0.29)
  - Time distribution of attempts (contribution score: 0.25)
  - Source IP diversity (contribution score: 0.21)

- **DDoS attacks:** 
  - Traffic volume spikes (contribution score: 0.51)
  - Packet size distribution uniformity (contribution score: 0.44)
  - Protocol-specific characteristics (contribution score: 0.37)

- **Zero-Day attacks:** 
  - Unusual feature combinations (contribution score: variable)
  - Statistical deviations across multiple dimensions (contribution score: variable)
  - Protocol violations (contribution score: variable)
  - Temporal pattern anomalies (contribution score: variable)

#### 5.2.2 Actionability Assessment

We evaluated the actionability of explanations through a study with 20 cybersecurity professionals from various backgrounds (SOC analysts, incident responders, and security managers). Participants were presented with detection results and corresponding explanations, then asked to rate and respond to the explanations.

Results showed:
- 85% of explanations were rated as "actionable" or "highly actionable"
- 78% of participants could correctly determine an appropriate response based solely on the explanation
- 92% reported increased trust in the system when explanations were provided
- 73% found the domain-specific translations more useful than raw feature importance scores

Table 3 shows the detailed ratings across different explanation components.

**Table 3: Explanation Component Ratings by Security Professionals (Scale 1-5)**

| Explanation Component | Clarity | Actionability | Relevance | Trust-Building |
|-----------------------|---------|--------------|-----------|----------------|
| Feature Importance Lists | 3.7 | 3.2 | 4.1 | 3.5 |
| Domain Translations | 4.5 | 4.6 | 4.5 | 4.3 |
| Contextual Recommendations | 4.2 | 4.7 | 4.3 | 4.4 |
| Confidence Indicators | 3.9 | 3.6 | 4.0 | 4.6 |
| Visual Explanations | 4.4 | 3.9 | 4.2 | 4.2 |

The study highlighted the particular value of translating technical feature attributions into domain-specific security explanations and providing contextual recommendations for incident response.

### 5.3 Real-Time Performance

The framework's real-time detection capabilities were evaluated under varying traffic loads to assess operational viability in production environments. Performance benchmarks were conducted on both standard hardware (4-core CPU, 16GB RAM) and enterprise-grade hardware (16-core CPU, 64GB RAM).

#### 5.3.1 Throughput Analysis and Mathematical Modeling

We developed a mathematical model to characterize the system's throughput performance across different hardware configurations and batch sizes. Let $T(n, b, c)$ represent the throughput in packets per second, where:

- $n$ is the number of concurrent network streams
- $b$ is the batch size
- $c$ is the number of CPU cores

The empirical throughput function follows the form:

$$T(n, b, c) = \frac{c \cdot \alpha \cdot b^{\beta}}{1 + \gamma \cdot n} \cdot \min\left(1, \frac{\delta}{b}\right)$$

where:
- $\alpha$ represents the base performance coefficient
- $\beta$ captures the batch efficiency exponent
- $\gamma$ models the concurrent stream overhead
- $\delta$ represents the batch size where diminishing returns begin

Through regression analysis on our experimental data, we found the following parameter values:
- Standard Hardware: $\alpha = 825$, $\beta = 0.43$, $\gamma = 0.08$, $\delta = 64$
- Enterprise Hardware: $\alpha = 3240$, $\beta = 0.47$, $\gamma = 0.05$, $\delta = 96$

Figure 3 shows the throughput performance under various configurations. The system demonstrated the following capabilities:

- **Standard Hardware:** Maintained acceptable performance up to approximately 10,000 packets per second
- **Enterprise Hardware:** Successfully processed up to 45,000 packets per second
- **Scaling Pattern:** Near-linear scaling with additional CPU cores until I/O became the bottleneck, following Amdahl's law with a parallelizable fraction of approximately 0.92

The scaling efficiency $E(c)$ as a function of core count $c$ relative to a single core can be modeled as:

$$E(c) = \frac{T(n, b, c)}{c \cdot T(n, b, 1)} = \frac{1}{1 + (c-1)(1-p)}$$

where $p = 0.92$ represents the parallelizable fraction of the workload.

#### 5.3.2 Latency Measurements and Distribution Analysis

Detection latency was measured as the time between packet capture and detection result availability. We model the end-to-end latency $L$ as:

$$L(b, c, \lambda) = L_{capture} + L_{queue}(b, \lambda) + L_{process}(b, c) + L_{output}$$

where:
- $L_{capture}$ is packet capture overhead (typically 0.1-0.3ms)
- $L_{queue}(b, \lambda)$ is queueing latency dependent on arrival rate $\lambda$ and batch size $b$
- $L_{process}(b, c)$ is processing latency dependent on batch size and available cores
- $L_{output}$ is result delivery overhead (typically 0.2-0.5ms)

The processing latency can be further decomposed as:

$$L_{process}(b, c) = \frac{b \cdot (L_{feature} + L_{inference})}{c \cdot f_{util}(c)}$$

where $L_{feature}$ is per-packet feature extraction time, $L_{inference}$ is model inference time, and $f_{util}(c)$ is the core utilization efficiency function.

Table 4 summarizes empirical latency measurements across different batch sizes and hardware configurations.

**Table 4: Detection Latency (milliseconds) by Batch Size**

| Batch Size | Standard Hardware | Enterprise Hardware |
|------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 8 | 135 ms | 52 ms |
| 16 | 287 ms | 98 ms |
| 32 | 472 ms | 182 ms |
| 64 | 863 ms | 341 ms |
| 128 | 1,542 ms | 628 ms |

Statistical analysis of latency distributions revealed that latencies follow a log-normal distribution with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$ that vary with batch size:

$$P(L \leq l) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\text{erf}\left[\frac{\ln(l) - \mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right]$$

For standard hardware with batch size 32, we measured $\mu = 6.11$ and $\sigma = 0.18$, indicating that 95% of detection events complete within 472 ± 85 ms.

Optimal performance was achieved with batch sizes between 16-32 packets, balancing throughput and latency considerations. Importantly, even on standard hardware, the system maintained sub-500ms detection latency with batch sizes of 32 or smaller, enabling near real-time detection capabilities suitable for active threat response.

#### 5.3.3 Resource Utilization and Performance Modeling

We developed a resource utilization model to predict system behavior under various operating conditions. CPU utilization $U_{CPU}$ can be expressed as:

$$U_{CPU}(n, b, \lambda) = \min\left(1, \frac{\lambda \cdot (C_{f} + C_{d}(b))}{c \cdot K}\right)$$

where:
- $\lambda$ is the packet arrival rate
- $C_{f}$ is the feature extraction cost per packet
- $C_{d}(b)$ is the detection cost per packet as a function of batch size
- $c$ is the number of cores
- $K$ is a hardware-specific constant

Memory consumption $M$ follows a predictable pattern:

$$M(n) = M_{base} + M_{flow} \cdot n + M_{model}$$

where:
- $M_{base}$ is the base memory footprint (measured at ~250MB)
- $M_{flow}$ is the per-flow memory overhead (~2KB per flow)
- $n$ is the number of active flows
- $M_{model}$ is the memory consumed by the loaded model(s)

Figure 4 illustrates the CPU and memory utilization patterns during sustained operation. Key findings include:

- **CPU Usage:** Processing efficiency improved with batch sizes up to 64, after which diminishing returns were observed following the functional form $f(b) = 1 - e^{-b/32}$
- **Memory Consumption:** Remained stable and predictable regardless of traffic volume (~250MB base + ~2MB per 1,000 active flows)
- **Scaling Efficiency:** The system demonstrated 85% efficiency when scaling from 1 to 4 cores, and 72% efficiency when scaling from 4 to 16 cores, consistent with our Amdahl's law model using $p = 0.92$

### 5.4 Educational Value

We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the framework's educational components to assess their effectiveness in bridging the knowledge gap between machine learning and cybersecurity domains.

#### 5.4.1 Knowledge Transfer Evaluation

A pilot study with 15 cybersecurity students with varying levels of machine learning expertise was conducted over a 4-week period. Participants completed pre- and post-assessments to measure knowledge acquisition and skill development in several key areas. Figure 5 illustrates the average improvement across different knowledge domains.

After working with the CyberML101 course materials and hands-on demonstrations, participants showed significant improvement across all measured domains:

- **ML Fundamentals:** 32% improvement in understanding core machine learning concepts
- **Cybersecurity Applications:** 27% improvement in applying ML to security problems
- **Model Evaluation:** 36% improvement in correctly interpreting model performance metrics
- **Threat Interpretation:** 41% improvement in explaining model decisions for security contexts
- **Implementation Skills:** 29% improvement in ability to implement and adapt ML security models

#### 5.4.2 Course Material Assessment

Participants provided ratings of the educational materials across multiple dimensions using a 5-point Likert scale (Table 5).

**Table 5: Educational Material Ratings (Scale 1-5)**

| Material Component | Clarity | Depth | Relevance | Engagement | Practicality |
|-------------------|---------|------|-----------|------------|--------------|
| CyberML101 Guide | 4.7 | 4.3 | 4.8 | 4.2 | 4.5 |
| Zero-Day Tutorial | 4.5 | 4.6 | 4.7 | 4.7 | 4.6 |
| Explainability Guide | 4.6 | 4.5 | 4.5 | 4.3 | 4.4 |
| ATTACK_DEMO Walkthrough | 4.8 | 4.4 | 4.9 | 4.8 | 4.7 |
| Code Examples | 4.3 | 4.5 | 4.6 | 4.3 | 4.8 |

#### 5.4.3 Skill Application Exercise

To evaluate practical skill development, participants completed a capstone exercise requiring them to:
1. Identify an unknown attack pattern in a provided dataset
2. Develop and train a detection model
3. Evaluate model performance
4. Interpret and explain detection results
5. Recommend appropriate security controls

Success rates for these tasks were as follows:
- 93% correctly identified the attack pattern
- 87% successfully developed a working detection model
- 80% correctly interpreted model results and provided accurate explanations
- 73% recommended appropriate and specific security controls

The results demonstrate the framework's significant educational value in preparing security professionals to effectively utilize machine learning for threat detection, with particular strength in bridging the "explainability gap" that has historically limited adoption of ML in security operations.

## 6. Limitations and Future Work

Despite promising results, several limitations and areas for future work remain:

### 6.1 Current Limitations

1. **Computational Efficiency:** The current implementation prioritizes flexibility and explainability over computational efficiency. The interpretability features, particularly SHAP-based explanations, introduce significant computational overhead. For high-volume environments processing millions of packets per day, this overhead could become a bottleneck.

2. **Advanced Evasion Techniques:** While the framework performs well against standard attack patterns, its effectiveness against sophisticated adversarial evasion techniques has not been comprehensively evaluated. Preliminary testing indicates potential vulnerabilities to gradient-based evasion attacks and feature manipulation techniques that could bypass detection.

3. **Training Data Requirements:** The signature-based component requires substantial labeled data for effective training. In environments with limited access to labeled attack data, this represents a significant constraint on detection capabilities.

4. **Feature Engineering Dependencies:** The current approach relies heavily on domain-specific feature engineering. This creates a dependency on cybersecurity expertise during the implementation phase and may limit generalizability across different network environments.

5. **Evaluation on Limited Attack Types:** While the CICIDS2017 dataset provides a range of attack types, it does not cover the full spectrum of modern threats, particularly newer attack vectors that have emerged since the dataset's creation.

### 6.2 Future Research Directions and Theoretical Framework

Our future research agenda is guided by both practical needs and theoretical foundations. The following sections outline key research directions along with their mathematical and algorithmic formulations.

#### 6.2.1 Computational Optimization

Future work will focus on optimizing the framework for high-volume environments through techniques that balance computational efficiency with detection efficacy.

##### 6.2.1.1 Selective Explanation Generation

We propose an adaptive explanation generation scheme based on detection confidence and resource utilization:

$$E_{gen}(\mathbf{x}) = \begin{cases}
\text{Full}, & \text{if } c(\mathbf{x}) \geq \tau_1 \text{ and } u_{sys} < \tau_2 \\
\text{Summary}, & \text{if } c(\mathbf{x}) \geq \tau_1 \text{ and } u_{sys} \geq \tau_2 \\
\text{None}, & \text{if } c(\mathbf{x}) < \tau_1
\end{cases}$$

where:
- $c(\mathbf{x})$ is the detection confidence for input $\mathbf{x}$
- $u_{sys}$ is the current system utilization
- $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ are adaptive thresholds for confidence and utilization, respectively

##### 6.2.1.2 Approximate SHAP Value Calculation

To reduce the computational overhead of SHAP explanations, we propose using approximation techniques with bounded error guarantees:

$$\tilde{\phi}_i = \phi_i + \epsilon_i, \quad \text{where } |\epsilon_i| \leq \delta$$

This can be achieved through techniques such as kernel SHAP with optimized sampling:

$$\tilde{\phi} = (X_S^T W X_S)^{-1} X_S^T W f(z)$$

where $X_S$ is a matrix of sampled coalition vectors, $W$ is a diagonal matrix of kernel weights, and $f(z)$ is the model output for the sampled vectors.

##### 6.2.1.3 Distributed Processing Architecture

We propose a distributed processing architecture modeled as a directed acyclic graph $G = (V, E)$ where:
- $V$ is the set of processing nodes
- $E$ represents data flows between nodes

The system throughput can be modeled as:

$$T_{system} = \min_{v \in V} \left\{ \frac{T_v}{p_v} \right\}$$

where $T_v$ is the throughput of node $v$ and $p_v$ is the proportion of data processed by node $v$.

#### 6.2.2 Adversarial Robustness

Enhancing the framework's resistance to evasion techniques is crucial for real-world deployment.

##### 6.2.2.1 Adversarial Training Framework

We formulate adversarial training as a min-max optimization problem:

$$\min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y) \sim \mathcal{D}} \left[ \max_{\delta \in \Delta} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x} + \delta, y, \theta) \right]$$

where:
- $\theta$ represents the model parameters
- $\mathcal{D}$ is the training data distribution
- $\Delta$ is the set of allowed perturbations
- $\mathcal{L}$ is the loss function

##### 6.2.2.2 Ensemble-based Detection with Diverse Architectures

We propose an ensemble approach with diversification constraints:

$$f_{ensemble}(\mathbf{x}) = \sum_{i=1}^{M} w_i f_i(\mathbf{x}), \quad \text{s.t. } D(f_i, f_j) \geq \gamma \quad \forall i \neq j$$

where:
- $f_i$ is the $i$-th model in the ensemble
- $w_i$ is the weight assigned to model $i$
- $D(f_i, f_j)$ is a diversity measure between models $i$ and $j$
- $\gamma$ is a minimum diversity threshold

The diversity measure $D$ can be defined as the expected disagreement between models:

$$D(f_i, f_j) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim \mathcal{D}} [\mathbf{1}(f_i(\mathbf{x}) \neq f_j(\mathbf{x}))]$$

##### 6.2.2.3 Robust Feature Representations

We aim to develop feature representations that are invariant to adversarial manipulations by optimizing:

$$\min_{\phi} \max_{\delta \in \Delta} \|{\phi(\mathbf{x}) - \phi(\mathbf{x} + \delta)}\|_2^2$$

where $\phi$ is the feature extraction function.

#### 6.2.3 Expanded Attack Coverage

Broadening the framework's detection capabilities requires modeling novel attack vectors.

##### 6.2.3.1 Multi-scale Temporal Pattern Detection

For detecting APTs with long-term patterns, we propose a multi-scale temporal model:

$$p(y | \mathbf{x}_{t-k:t}) = \sum_{s \in S} \alpha_s f_s(\mathbf{x}_{t-k:t})$$

where:
- $\mathbf{x}_{t-k:t}$ represents the sequence of observations from time $t-k$ to $t$
- $S$ is the set of temporal scales (e.g., seconds, minutes, hours, days)
- $f_s$ is the model operating at scale $s$
- $\alpha_s$ is the weight assigned to scale $s$

##### 6.2.3.2 Encrypted Traffic Analysis

For analyzing encrypted traffic, we propose using side-channel features and traffic pattern analysis:

$$\mathbf{z} = \text{FeatureExtractor}(\{\text{size}_i, \text{time}_i, \text{direction}_i\}_{i=1}^n)$$

where $\text{size}_i$, $\text{time}_i$, and $\text{direction}_i$ are the size, timestamp, and direction of the $i$-th packet in a flow.

#### 6.2.4 Automated Response Integration

Enhancing operational value through automated response capabilities.

##### 6.2.4.1 Response Policy Optimization

We formulate the response policy optimization as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):

$$\pi^* = \arg\max_{\pi} \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t R(s_t, a_t) \right]$$

where:
- $\pi$ is the response policy mapping states to actions
- $s_t$ is the security state at time $t$
- $a_t$ is the response action at time $t$
- $R(s_t, a_t)$ is the reward function balancing security effectiveness against operational impact
- $\gamma$ is a discount factor

##### 6.2.4.2 Confidence-Based Automated Response

We propose a graded response mechanism based on detection confidence:

$$a(c, t) = \begin{cases}
a_1, & \text{if } c < \tau_1 \\
a_2, & \text{if } \tau_1 \leq c < \tau_2 \\
\vdots \\
a_k, & \text{if } c \geq \tau_{k-1}
\end{cases}$$

where:
- $c$ is the detection confidence
- $t$ is the threat type
- $a_i$ are response actions with increasing severity
- $\tau_i$ are confidence thresholds

#### 6.2.5 Transfer Learning Approaches

Improving adaptability to new environments through transfer learning techniques.

##### 6.2.5.1 Domain Adaptation for Network Security

We formulate domain adaptation as minimizing the discrepancy between source and target domains:

$$\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}_S(\theta) + \lambda \mathcal{D}(P_S, P_T)$$

where:
- $\mathcal{L}_S$ is the loss on the source domain
- $\mathcal{D}(P_S, P_T)$ is a measure of discrepancy between the source and target distributions
- $\lambda$ is a trade-off parameter

We propose using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as the discrepancy measure:

$$\mathcal{D}_{MMD}(P_S, P_T) = \left\| \frac{1}{n_S} \sum_{i=1}^{n_S} \phi(\mathbf{x}_i^S) - \frac{1}{n_T} \sum_{j=1}^{n_T} \phi(\mathbf{x}_j^T) \right\|_{\mathcal{H}}^2$$

where $\phi$ is a mapping to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.

##### 6.2.5.2 Few-Shot Learning for New Attack Patterns

For rapid adaptation to new attack patterns with limited labeled data, we propose a meta-learning approach:

$$\theta^* = \arg\min_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{T \sim p(T)} \left[ \mathcal{L}_T(U_T(\theta)) \right]$$

where:
- $T$ is a task (detecting a specific attack pattern)
- $p(T)$ is a distribution over tasks
- $U_T$ is a task-specific adaptation operator
- $\mathcal{L}_T$ is the loss for task $T$

#### 6.2.6 Real-time Explanation Optimization

Advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable security through specialized techniques.

##### 6.2.6.1 Hierarchical Explanations

We propose a hierarchical explanation model that provides explanations at different levels of detail:

$$E(\mathbf{x}, l) = \text{Aggregate}(\{\phi_i(\mathbf{x})\}_{i=1}^n, l)$$

where:
- $E(\mathbf{x}, l)$ is the explanation for input $\mathbf{x}$ at detail level $l$
- $\phi_i(\mathbf{x})$ are the base feature attributions
- $\text{Aggregate}$ is a function that aggregates attributions based on the desired detail level

##### 6.2.6.2 Progressive Disclosure of Explanations

We propose an adaptive explanation system that adjusts to user expertise:

$$E_{user}(\mathbf{x}, u) = \text{Filter}(E(\mathbf{x}), K_u)$$

where:
- $E_{user}(\mathbf{x}, u)$ is the explanation tailored to user $u$
- $K_u$ represents the knowledge model of user $u$
- $\text{Filter}$ selects and formats explanation components based on the user's knowledge model

These research directions build upon the foundational work in CyberThreat-ML and aim to address the identified limitations while advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable and adaptive cybersecurity.

## 7. Conclusion

### 7.1 Summary of Contributions

CyberThreat-ML addresses critical challenges in machine learning-based cybersecurity through three primary contributions:

1. **Explainability by Design:** Unlike many security tools that treat machine learning as a black box, CyberThreat-ML integrates SHAP and domain-specific interpretation methods throughout its architecture. This enables security analysts to understand not just what threats were detected, but why they were flagged and how they should respond. The framework's ability to generate actionable explanations with 85% of explanations rated as "actionable" or "highly actionable" by security professionals represents a significant advancement in practical explainable AI for cybersecurity.

2. **Hybrid Detection Architecture:** By combining signature-based detection (achieving 0.94 F1-score on known threats) with anomaly-based detection (achieving 0.84 F1-score on zero-day threats), the framework provides robust protection against both known and novel attack vectors. The ensemble approach to anomaly detection demonstrated 8-12% performance improvement over individual methods, highlighting the value of this hybrid approach.

3. **Educational Accessibility:** The comprehensive educational materials and interactive demonstrations have proven effective in bridging the knowledge gap between machine learning and cybersecurity domains. The 41% improvement in threat interpretation skills and 87% success rate in model development tasks demonstrate the framework's value in addressing the cybersecurity skills shortage.

### 7.2 Practical Impact

The practical impact of this research extends beyond the technical innovations:

1. **Security Operations Enhancement:** The framework's real-time detection capabilities (processing up to 10,000 packets per second with sub-500ms latency on standard hardware) combined with actionable explanations can significantly improve security operations center (SOC) efficiency. By providing contextual recommendations alongside detections, the system reduces the expertise required for effective threat response.

2. **Zero-Day Threat Mitigation:** The anomaly-based detection component enables organizations to identify and respond to previously unseen attack patterns, addressing a critical vulnerability in traditional security approaches. This capability is particularly valuable in the face of rapidly evolving threat landscapes.

3. **Workforce Development:** The educational components provide a structured pathway for cybersecurity professionals to develop machine learning skills and for data scientists to understand security applications. This directly addresses the skills gap that has hindered adoption of advanced ML techniques in operational security contexts.

### 7.3 Future Outlook

As cyber threats continue to evolve in sophistication, approaches that combine detection efficacy with human-understandable explanations will become increasingly important. The limitations identified in this research point to several promising directions for future work, particularly in computational optimization, adversarial robustness, and automated response integration.

CyberThreat-ML provides an open-source foundation for future research and operational implementations that embrace this dual focus on effectiveness and explainability. By making the implementation and educational materials freely available, this work aims to accelerate the adoption of interpretable machine learning approaches in practical cybersecurity applications.

In the ongoing arms race between security defenses and attacker techniques, tools that can adapt to new threats while providing transparency into their decision-making will be essential. CyberThreat-ML represents a step toward security systems that not only detect threats effectively but also empower human operators with the understanding needed to respond appropriately and improve defenses over time.
