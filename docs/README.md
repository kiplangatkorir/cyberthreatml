# CyberThreat-ML Documentation

## Introduction

CyberThreat-ML is a comprehensive Python library for real-time cybersecurity threat detection using machine learning. It combines signature-based detection for known threats and anomaly detection for zero-day threats, all with powerful explainability features.

## Features

- **Signature-Based Detection**: Detect known threats using supervised machine learning
- **Zero-Day Detection**: Identify unknown threats using anomaly detection
- **Real-Time Processing**: Process network traffic in real-time
- **Explainable AI**: Understand why something was flagged as a threat
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive dashboards for threat monitoring
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously improve detection as network patterns evolve

## Getting Started

2. [Zero-Day Tutorial](ZeroDay_Tutorial.md) - Step-by-step guide to building a zero-day detection system
3. [Explainability Guide](Explainability_Guide.md) - Detailed explanation of the library's interpretability features
4. [Quick Reference](QuickReference.md) - Code snippets for common tasks
5. [FAQ](FAQ.md) - Answers to frequently asked questions

## Core Components

The library consists of several key modules:

- **model**: Core ML model implementation
- **anomaly**: Zero-day threat detection using anomaly detection algorithms
- **realtime**: Real-time processing of network traffic
- **preprocessing**: Feature extraction and data preparation
- **evaluation**: Model evaluation and performance metrics
- **visualization**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations
- **interpretability**: Tools for explaining model predictions
- **explain**: SHAP-based model explanations

## Example Usage

```python
from cyberthreat_ml.model import ThreatDetectionModel
from cyberthreat_ml.realtime import PacketStreamDetector
from cyberthreat_ml.anomaly import ZeroDayDetector

# Create and train a model for known threats
model = ThreatDetectionModel(input_shape=(10,), num_classes=5)
model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Create a zero-day detector for unknown threats
zero_day_detector = ZeroDayDetector(method='ensemble')
zero_day_detector.fit(normal_data)

# Set up real-time detection
detector = PacketStreamDetector(model, feature_extractor)
detector.start()

# Process network packets
detector.process_packet(packet_data)
```
